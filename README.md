# Projects
A folder containing projects I did/participated in:
SpaceIL - sending the first Israeli spacecraft to the Moon. I was part of the landing site team, and in this folder some of the codes we have used, e.g. checking there are no natural obstacles blocking sunlight from reaching to the spacecraft's solar panels, or blocking antenna communication.
